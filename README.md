# Checking-amount-sales-each-city-in-coming-years
Checking the amount of product sales in each city

In this project, I plan to check the sales of each city's products and first see what the total sales of a city will be in the coming years, and then see which products each city can focus on selling more.

This project is designed to analyze sales data.

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `Sales Data.csv`: The raw sales dataset containing order information, price, city, and date.  
- `Number-products-sales-each_city.py`: The initial analysis script that examines total sales per city.
